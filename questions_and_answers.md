  <h1>MCQ TEST</h1>
</div>

###### 1. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
let greeting;
greetign = {};
console.log(greetign);
```

- A: `{}`
- B: `ReferenceError: greetign is not defined`
- C: `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

<i>Because here we declare the value of greetign as {} then print the value of that. Even though we didn't declare the variable for greetign javascript still treats it as a variable. Then print the value of it like a normal JavaScript variable. </i>

###### 2. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

sum(1, "2");
```

- A: `NaN`
- B: `TypeError`
- C: `"12"`
- D: `3`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

<i>The answer would be "12" because we can see that the value of a is an integer but the value of b is a string. So when a string and integer gets used in a sum without using parse then it becomes a string and just place the value next to the previous one.</i>

###### 3. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
const food = ["🍕", "🍫", "🥑", "🍔"];
const info = { favoriteFood: food[0] };

info.favoriteFood = "🍝";

console.log(food);
```

- A: `['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- B: `['🍝', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- C: `['🍝', '🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

<i>This code doesn't change the value of food as food and info are different variables. The code changed the value of info. Before it would print the first emoji from food. But after changing it would print the new emoji.</i>

###### 4. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
function sayHi(name) {
  return `Hi there, ${name}`;
}

console.log(sayHi());
```

- A: `Hi there,`
- B: `Hi there, undefined`
- C: `Hi there, null`
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

<i>In the above code we see a function taking a parameter called name then return the output with that parameter in a string.But when we are calling the function when printing it we didn't give it any parameter. That's why it doesn't find any parameter and prints undefined instead of the parameter value.</i>

###### 5. Write the `correct answer` from the following options and give an explanation (2-5 lines).

```javascript
let count = 0;
const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];

nums.forEach((num) => {
  if (num) count += 1;
});

console.log(count);
```

- A: 1
- B: 2
- C: 3
- D: 4

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

<i>The answer is 3. Here we are checking the count value after the function. In the function it checks if num has a value. For the first loop the value of num is 0. Because of that the condition is false as 0 is a falsy value. So it does't continue the count+=1 operation for that loop. It then goes to the next loops and as they are true value the conditional operation continues counts them. Thus for the remaining 3 value the count is 3.</i>
